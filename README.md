# Qryptix Password Manager

## This is a project that I have originally created for LokDon LLC which I cofounded. However, the idea and the code is 100% mine and all the infrastructure and resources used for this project are funded by myself. Since the branding was originally owned by LokDon LLC, I have to rebrand this project before making it available for the public. Please follow me for updates.

Qryptix Password Manager is a secure and convenient way to store and manage your passwords, notes, cards, and files. It uses a 4096 bit quantum proof algorithm to encrypt your data, and syncs it with your browser and a private encrypted cloud. It also protects your credit and debit cards from fraud and scam, and lets you access your most valuable files with the EVault system.
